# Criminality Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing criminality data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights. Using data visualization and statistical techniques, it provides a comprehensive exploration of crime occurrences over time and across different regions.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Visualization**: Generating insightful visualizations to highlight patterns in the data.
- **Analysis**: Statistical exploration to identify correlations and trends.

## Objectives
The main goal of this project is to provide actionable insights from criminality data, which can aid policymakers and law enforcement agencies in resource allocation and strategy planning.

## How to Use
1. Ensure all required Python libraries are installed (e.g., pandas, matplotlib, seaborn).
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`criminality.ipynb`).
3. Follow the steps in the notebook to explore the data and visualizations.
